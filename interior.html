    <!--Hello, hello! Thanks for taking a look at my code. 
        This site was created without any frameworks using a combination of SASS, CSS Grid, HTML5, JS, and custom jQuery. 
        This is in-line with the direction I'm hoping to continue progressing in rather than relying on frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation, however, I have years of experience with these as well.
        My goal is to continue growing and expanding my repertoire of development abilities.
        I'm currently working on learning React and deepening my understanding of JS.
        github for this project can be found at: https://github.com/seerad/cd-portfolio.git -->

            <p>I’m Conrad Davenport, a <strong>creative problem solver</strong> working as a UX/UI designer and front-end developer. I’m currently the Director of Web Design and Development at Advantage Internet Marketing. I’ve spent the last 12 years leading the design and development of over 300 websites. <strong>My focus is on understanding and empathizing the users’ needs.</strong> </p>

                        <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> The Problem</h2>
                        <p>This project involved taking a well established political organization from Virginia that handles Virginia's Space division out of Wallop's Island and creating a more impressive experience for their users.</p>
                        <h2><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> The Solution</h2>
                        <p>The goal for this site was to create a stunning, multi-layer visual site that showcases the strengths of the organization. I chose to highlight their launches and support of the International Space Station. From an information standpoint, I wanted the UX to remain simple and direct providing a basic overview of the organization and a clean navigation to easily find the next set of information a user is looking for. I highlighted their launches as this is the more visually impressive and attention grabbing part of what they do.</p>
                        <h2><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> The Testing</h2>
                        <p>I worked with several users throughout the process sharing progress and gathering feedback noting areas that felt "off" or like they needed adjusted. Seeing a user stop or hesitate in an area that was unintended interupts the UX and can create a scenario that can lead to user dropoff or bounce.</p>
                        <h2><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> The Process</h2>
                        <p>As part of the user experience design, other space agencies were researched as well as their existing website. I analyzed the information that they were providing and developed a revised sitemap that better organized the navigation to make it easier for the user. Several rounds of simple wireframes were created with Sketch to work through the UX before proceeding with designing the UI and Visual design for the page. Photoshop was used to create the top banner with several images and typography combined to create a stunning visual Hero. I will be revisiting this project to build out other pages, possibly expand on the homepage UX, and add animation to pull it all together.</p>

                <h2>Strategy. Prototype. Design. Innovate.</h2>
                <p>Over the years, I've thrived in situations where I'm told things can't be done; I've learned that <strong>a user complaint often isn't a user error, but a UX error</strong>; and that there is almost <strong>ALWAYS</strong> a better way of building something (especially in our industry). I desire to continue learning, collaborating, and teaching what I know while focusing more on <strong>UX/UI, Product Design, and Front-End Development.</strong></p>
                <p>In all that I work on, I take time to understand <strong>the user's needs</strong> and why they're ultimately on a site/app in the first place. This is the foundation of the wireframes, visual design, and strategy.</p>
