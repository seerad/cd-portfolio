                    <p>We analyzed the user needs and what was most important to them. For this sevice industry, what people are purchasing isn't a clean house (typically), they're purchasing the freedom of not having to do it themselves providing them with more time to do what they love. After we established the user need, we looked at what sort of problems and issues/reservations the client may have in hiring a home cleaning company. Our above the fold messaging brought together the company's existing branding (enjoy the harmony) and combined this with the company's unique value propositions and trustbuilding statements... trusted, 1000s of happy customers, testimonials, etc.</p>

                    <h2><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> The Process</h2>
                    <p>I began with handdrawn wireframes to analyze the overall User Experience Design and how we could best present the solution to the user and lead them through the process of signing up for an estimate. During this stage, the initial idea for utilizing motion on images to re-enforce the idea of making memories was developed. These wireframes were taken into Photoshop to create high-fidelity mockups of the mobile and desktop versions as well as an interior page layout. Because of the strong SEO and AdWords strategy, the interior pages were created to function as individual landing pages presenting their core messaging for users. These high-fidelity mockups were taken and implemented into a custom Wordpress theme using Foundation for the framework.</p>

                <h2>What I Do</h2>
                <p>Over the years, I've thrived in situations where I'm told things can't be done; I've learned that a user complaint often isn't a user error, but a UX error; and that there is almost ALWAYS a better way of building something (especially in our industry). My desire is to continue learning, collaborating, and teaching what I know while focusing more on UX/UI, Product Design, and Front-End Development.</p>
                <p>In all that I work on, I take time to understand the users needs and why they're ultimately on a site/app in the first place. This is the foundation of the wireframes, visual design, and strategy.</p>
