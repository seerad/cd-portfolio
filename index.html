    <!--Hello, hello! Thanks for taking a look at my code. 
        This site was created without any frameworks using a combination of SASS, CSS Grid, HTML5, JS, and custom jQuery. 
        This is in-line with the direction I'm hoping to continue progressing in rather than relying on frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation.
        My goal is to continue growing and expanding my repertoire of development abilities.
        I'm currently working on learning React and deepening my understanding of JS.
        github for this project can be found at: https://github.com/seerad/cd-portfolio.git -->

                    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> The Problem</h2>
                    <p>The client wanted a modern solution for their website that was more than just a brochure of services and re-enforced their existing branding.</p>
                </div>   
                <div class="case-study__section">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> The Solution</h2>
                    <p>We analyzed the user needs and what was most important to them. For this service industry, what people are purchasing isn't a clean house, but instead the freedom of not having to do it themselves. This provides them with more time to do what they love. After we established the user need, we looked at what sort of problems and reservations the client may have in hiring a home cleaning company. Our above the fold messaging brought together the company's existing branding (enjoy the harmony) and combined this with the company's unique value propositions and trust-building statements... trusted, 1000s of happy customers, testimonials, etc.</p>

                    <h2><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> The Process</h2>
                    <p>I began with hand-drawn wireframes to analyze the overall User Experience Design and how we could best present the solution to the user and lead them through the process of signing up for an estimate. During this stage, the initial idea for utilizing motion on images to re-enforce the idea of making memories was developed. These wireframes were taken into Photoshop to create high-fidelity mockups of the mobile and desktop versions as well as an interior page layout. Because of the strong SEO and AdWords strategy, the interior pages were created to function as individual landing pages presenting their core messaging for users. These high-fidelity mockups were taken and implemented into a custom Wordpress theme using Foundation for the framework.</p>

                    <p>The client's industry has to speak to users dealing with immediate problems like a broken down car or an alarming dash light. They have to quickly build trust before the user looks elsewhere.</p>

                <div class="case-study__section">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> The Solution</h2>
                    <p>Because of the high likelihood of a user needing urgent assistance, we focused on strong initial statements and a strong mobile experience to pair with an aggressive PPC and SEO campaign. In the first two sections, you can see immediate and direct trust-building statements communicating the trust that <em>others</em> have already consistently put in them.</p>

                    <p>I began with wireframes created in Adobe XD to analyze the overall User Experience Design and how the experience would be presented across devices. The site traffic was too low to effectively A/B test, so I used conversion rate optimization best practices and past auto industry experience to construct a User Experience that guides the user through the conversion funnel leading to them to contact the client. These wireframes were taken into Photoshop to produce high-fidelity mockups before implementing them in Wordpress and Foundation 6.</p>

                    <p>When doing user research, determining what <em>brought</em> a user to a site and what their motiviations were is often as important as strategizing what you want them to do once they're there. This site was wireframed with wireframe.cc and began with a mobile-first design that started in browser and had strong messaging and call-to-actions.</p>

                        <p>This is a more recent project and one of the first that I built with Bootstrap (ironically, their previous version from 5 years before was the first I built with Foundation). Working through the wireframes for this, I knew I wanted a highly custom look and feel that built brand trust emphasizing their reviews, testimonials, and experience.</p>

The wireframes were then built into HTML and CSS/SASS with Bootstrap, NPM, and Gulp in browser.</p>

                <p>Over the years, I've thrived in situations where I'm told things can't be done; I've learned that <strong>a user complaint often isn't a user error, but a UX error</strong>; and that there is almost <strong>ALWAYS</strong> a better way of building something (especially in our industry). I desire to continue learning, collaborating, and teaching what I know while focusing more on <strong>UX/UI, Product Design, and Front-End Development.</strong></p>
                <p>In all that I work on, I take time to understand <strong>the user's needs</strong> and why they're ultimately on a site/app in the first place. This is the foundation of the wireframes, visual design, and strategy.</p>
