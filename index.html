    <!--Hello, hello! Thanks for taking a look at my code. 
        This site was created without any frameworks using a combination of SASS, CSS Grid, HTML5, JS, and custom jQuery. 
        This is in-line with the direction I'm hoping to continue progressing in rather than relying on frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation, however, I have years of experience with these as well.
        My goal is to continue growing and expanding my repertoire of development abilities.
        I'm currently working on learning React and deepening my understanding of JS.
        github for this project can be found at: https://github.com/seerad/cd-portfolio.git -->

                            <p>This project involved taking a well established political organization from Virginia that handles Virginia's Space division out of Wallop's Island and creating a more impressive experience for their users.</p>

                            <h2><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> The Solution</h2>
                            <p>The goal for this site was to create a stunning, multi-layer visual site that showcases the strengths of the organization. I chose to highlight their launches and support of the International Space Station. From an information standpoint, I wanted the UX to remain simple and direct providing a basic overview of the organization and a clean navigation to easily find the next set of information a user is looking for. I highlighted their launches as this is the more visually impressive and attention grabbing part of what they do.</p>

                            <p>I worked with several users throughout the process sharing progress and gathering feedback noting areas that felt "off" or like they needed adjusted. Seeing a user stop or hesitate in an area that was unintended interupts the UX and can create a scenario that can lead to user dropoff or bounce.</p>

                            <p>As part of the user experience design, other space agencies were researched as well as their existing website. I analyzed the information that they were providing and developed a revised sitemap that better organized the navigation to make it easier for the user. Several rounds of simple wireframes were created with Sketch to work through the UX before proceeding with designing the UI and Visual design for the page. Photoshop was used to create the top banner with several images and typography combined to create a stunning visual Hero. I will be revisiting this project to build out other pages, possibly expand on the homepage UX, and add animation to pull it all together.</p>

                            <p>This project involved taking an existing brand and product and putting together a user experience that would help users to signup via an app.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>It was important to maintain the tone of their product and brand that carries through all of their marketing. I wanted to provide an experience not just for signup, but also a way to access your account and review your cigars from your latest box. I implemented a solution in the prototype as the user went through the taste test that allowed them to make their selection and then change it (if they wanted to) before moving to the next question. The goal was to allow the user to be confident before moving to the next question.</p>

                            <p>Early in the user testing it became apparent that users were stumbling a little bit through the questionnaire. In feedback, I learned that they prefer moving to the next question immediately upon answering versus requiring a double tap to progress. I removed this from the prototype and had the user proceed on initial tap. This still left the problem of accidentally choosing the wrong option. To solve this user problem, a back button was added to easily go back and re-select their option, while still only requiring a single interaction from the user.</p>

                            <p>I began by creating a base wireframe for the initial screen and the questionnaire in Adobe XD. After working through this and prototyping a few basic screens in the wireframe, I moved onto a high-fidelity mockup in XD, pulling in their branding and materials, as well as building out the additional screens needed for the prototype. I used XD's prototyping tools to create my connections and animate to present my UX/UI. I continued upon completion to design account screens detailing recent boxes, cigars, and access to the cigar journal. I used Photoshop to put together an initial screen to serve as a landing screen while the app started.</p>

                    <p>The client was using a Squarespace website that had minimal exposure and results. Our first job was researching the company, competitors, and most importantly their users.</p>

                    <p>The client's users will typically be visiting the site in a panic, so we wanted to ensure they could quickly reach out. We accomplished this by creating buttons that would quickly help them identify their need (the animal they saw) and provide them with information about how Bay Area solves that problem. We also prominently displayed their 24/7 policy, tesitmonials, and service areas partnered with strong call-to-actions with tap to call on mobile devices.</p>

                    <p>I began with an extensive client interview to understand their company and unique value proposition. This partnered with a competitive analysis provided me with the information I needed to put together a project scope detailing the user, who they are, what they need, and an overall plan of attack for the client. I reviewed this with the team and proceeded to create low-fidelity mockups in Adobe XD before creating high-fidelity mockups with Photoshop. We put a heavy emphasis on the design of the interior pages and created the mockup for this as well as handled content implementation.</p>

                    <p>We analyzed the user needs and what was most important to them. For this service industry, what people are purchasing isn't a clean house, but instead the freedom of not having to do it themselves. This provides them with more time to do what they love. After we established the user need, we looked at what sort of problems and reservations the client may have in hiring a home cleaning company. Our above the fold messaging brought together the company's existing branding (enjoy the harmony) and combined this with the company's unique value propositions and trust-building statements... trusted, 1000s of happy customers, testimonials, etc.</p>

During this stage, the initial idea for utilizing motion on images to re-enforce the idea of making memories was developed. These wireframes were taken into Photoshop to create high-fidelity mockups of the mobile and desktop versions as well as an interior page layout. Because of the strong SEO and AdWords strategy, the interior pages were created to function as individual landing pages presenting their core messaging for users. These high-fidelity mockups were taken and implemented into a custom Wordpress theme using Foundation for the framework.</p>

                        <p>This is a more recent project and one of the first that I built with Bootstrap (ironically, their previous version from 5 years before was the first I built with Foundation). Working through the wireframes for this, I knew I wanted a highly custom look and feel that built brand trust emphasizing their reviews, testimonials, and experience.</p>

                        <p>Wireframes for this project began in Adobe XD for both desktop and mobile to analyze the overall User Experience and how the user would be led through the sales funnel. Placing reviews, testimonials, and certifications near call to actions was an intentional decision to help with conversions. The wireframes were then built into HTML and CSS/SASS with Bootstrap, NPM, and Gulp in browser.</p>

                <h2>Strategy. Prototype. Design. Innovate.</h2>
                <p>Over the years, I've thrived in situations where I'm told things can't be done; I've learned that <strong>a user complaint often isn't a user error, but a UX error</strong>; and that there is almost <strong>ALWAYS</strong> a better way of building something (especially in our industry). I desire to continue learning, collaborating, and teaching what I know while focusing more on <strong>UX/UI, Product Design, and Front-End Development.</strong></p>
                <p>In all that I work on, I take time to understand <strong>the user's needs</strong> and why they're ultimately on a site/app in the first place. This is the foundation of the wireframes, visual design, and strategy.</p>
